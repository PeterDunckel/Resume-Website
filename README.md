# Resume-Website
Website for displaying Resume-related information

Currently:
It contains a menu that allows users to navigate between different tabs( profile, education, experience, skills, projects, and contacts).
The profile session has picture and summary. Education has classes past, present, and future, experience has my job experience info..
Skills contains my skills along with ratings. Projects has different school related projects and also uses menu to jump to different parts
of page and different sections. Contacts simply contains my email.

Next Steps:
Edit projects page to allow code to be in readable format. Add code to make resizing page functional with css.
