				  <h5>Summary</h5>
				  <div class="threeColumns">				  
					<p> My name is Peter Dunckel and I am currently a junior software engineering student at California Baptist University.
					I began programming my senior year of high school and haven't stopped since. 
					Programming allowed me to display my creativity in almost any matter I saw fit, which is why I fell in love with it.
					So I decided to continue my new found desire to program by pursuing a software engineering degree. 
					In college, I found that I was able to excel with programming because of my desire to learn and grow in software engineering.
					It wasn't until I was hired by a software engineer that I realized how much I really enjoyed software engineering and the passion I had for it.
					Through school, work experience and personal projects, I have grown substatially in my comprehesion of software engineering.
					I can now test, create, and operate many of the widely used programming languages and software tools that are available.
					My desire to continually grow and my unrelenting diligence distinguishes me from others.
					The work I complete is always completed to the best of my ability and with as much intelligent design as possible.
					Programming has unleashed my mind to see the many amazing things I can create through software engineering.
					Through advancing my knowledge on new technologies and coding, I hope to help revolutionize the software industry and the world.
					Programming is one of my passions and I am fortunate enough to have my passion also be my career.
					The programming languages I enjoy the most are C#, Java, and JavaScript.
					I hope that I can be apart of a team where I can share my knowledge, gain knowledge, make a wonderful product and make friends along the way.

								<p> The oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no space between words, and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized, and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original paragraphos, similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group.[3] The Greek paragraphos evolved into the pilcrow (Â¶), which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences. The hedera leaf (e.g. â˜™) has also been used in the same way. Indented paragraphs demonstrated in the US Constitution In ancient manuscripts, another means to divide sentences in into paragraphs was a line break (newline) followed by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversize capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.[4] Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States Constitution from 1787.

The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original paragraphos, similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group.[3] The Greek paragraphos evolved into the pilcrow (Â¶), which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences.

Indented paragraphs demonstrated in the US Constitution In ancient manuscripts, another means to divide sentences in into paragraphs was a line break (newline) followed by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversize capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.[4] Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States Constitution from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph whitespace, or put in the indentation space. A second common modern English style is to use no indenting, but add vertical whitespace to create "block paragraphs."

An initial is an oversize capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.[4] Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States Constitution from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph whitespace, or put in the indentation space. A second common modern English style is to use noThe oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no space between words, and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized, and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original paragraphos, similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group.[3] The Greek paragraphos evolved into the pilcrow (Â¶), which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences. The hedera leaf (e.g. â˜™) has also been used in the same way. Indented paragraphs demonstrated in the US Constitution In ancient manuscripts, another means to divide sentences in into paragraphs was a line break (newline) followed by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph.
